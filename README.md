Demo Cypress tests with WordPress

# Start of the demo
I'm using a Windows 10 Enterprise laptop with Windows Sandbox for this demo. In this document the laptop is called "host", the sanbox is called "sandbox". You can install Windows Sandbox by searching for "Turn on Windows Features" and then switch on Windows Sandbox on your laptop. Windows Sandbox also uses Hyper-V. Using WIndows Sandbox requires a reboot.

## Configure sandbox
Change the DemoCypressSandbox.wsb file in this repo to connect the directory where you cloned this repo from to C:\Demo. Start the sanbox by double clicking on this file. Within the sandbox, open a privileged Powershell window and execute the following commands:

Install Chocolatey (see: https://chocolatey.org/install)

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Take care of the questions that you have to answer during the installation of the software
```
choco feature enable -n allowGlobalConfirmation
```

Install the software
```
choco install nodejs googlechrome notepadplusplus
```

Open a new CMD window and execute the following commands to install Cypress:
```
cd \demo\initialize_wp_db
npm install cypress
cd \demo\write
npm install cypress
```

## Start wordpress and mysql database
On the host, start wordpress and mysql via Docker:

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name wordpress wordpress
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD='C1nder3llaInW0rdpre$$!' --name mysql mysql
```

Create the wordpress database (<-- enter *C1nder3llaInW0rdpre$$!* as the password):
```
docker exec -it mysql bash
mysql -u root -p                    
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'C1nder3llaInW0rdpre$$!';
exit
exit
```

You might have to open the firewall for port 80: the sandbox is not able to use the local host address for the connection to the host. We need to know what the current IP address is of the host:

```
ipconfig
```

I got very many network addresses. The first part of the output was:
```
C:\Users\Frederique>ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration


Ethernet adapter vEthernet (Default Switch):

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::81a5:3a46:b3a8:7aa9%16
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 172.25.0.1
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.240.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :
```

In the sandbox, open Chrome and go to http://172.25.0.1,  you should see the selection screen for languages from WordPress.

In the rest of this document, I'm using 172.25.0.1 (it worked for me, when it doesn't work for you please check the firewall and when it still doesn't work try another IP address from the list).

In the sandbox, change the IP address to your value in the files c:\demo\initialize_wp_db\config.cy.js and c:\demo\write\config.cy.js

## Initialize WordPress
In the sandbox, execute the following commands to start Cypress and initialize the database via Cypress:

```
cd \demo\initialize_wp_db
.\node_modules\.bin\cypress open
```
* Click on "Configured" under E2E testing
* Click on Electron and then click on the button "Start E2E testing in Electron"
* Click on the link initialize_wp_db.cy.js and watch how WordPress is initialized automatically ;-)

You now see that the configuration screens are filled in automatically. When everything goes well, you will see a list of green checkboxes in the left menu. Your WordPress database and WordPress container are configured to do the demo. You can stop the Cypress screens. 

# Demo

## Labels (Chrome)

In the demo, use the \demo\write directory as the base to show what is going on:
* Start Chrome
* Start notepad++, open c:\demo\write\
* Show via F12
